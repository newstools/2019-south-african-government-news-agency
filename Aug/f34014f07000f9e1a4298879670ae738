Mozambique Accord Meanwhile, Cabinet has also welcomed the signing of the Peace and Reconciliation Agreement in Mozambique which was attended by President Ramaphosa on Tuesday. The agreement follows the successful political dialogue between the government of Mozambique and the Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO), which culminated in the signing of an agreement on definitive cessation of military hostilities on 1 August 2019. “Cabinet welcomes the signing of the Peace and Reconciliation Agreement in Mozambique as a sign of solidarity with the people of Mozambique, and in support of peace and stability in the country,” said Cabinet. Cabinet further added that South Africa and Mozambique share cordial and fraternal bilateral, political, economic and social relations underpinned by strong historical ties dating back from the years of the liberation struggle. – SAnews.gov.za
