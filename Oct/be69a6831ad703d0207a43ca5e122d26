The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and South African Revenue Service (SARS) will, respectively, receive an additional R1.3 billion and R1 billion over the next two years as government bolsters corruption fighting efforts and improve revenue collection. Announcing this while delivering the Mid-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) in Parliament on Wednesday, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said the State is beginning to improve its efficiency. “Where possible, given budgetary constraints, government is shifting resources to areas that urgently need to strengthen capacity,” he said. Through reprioritisation, the NPA receives an additional R1.3 billion, and the South African Revenue Service receives an additional R1 billion for the next two years. These funding shifts, Mboweni said, will bolster efforts to combat corruption and improve revenue collection. Earlier this month, Cabinet approved over 14 000 hectares of land to be released for human settlements development. Mboweni said National Treasury has reviewed the procurement regulatory framework and developed a Public Procurement Bill. “It will be submitted to Parliament in due course,” he said. The Minister said the State is making progress on improving efficiency. “The State can use its budget better. For example, the South African National Defence Force buys more than R900 million worth of food a year,” he said. Operation Koba Tlala (meaning ‘Chase away the hunger’) is a deliberate action to buy this food from nearby suppliers, he said. – SAnews.gov.za
