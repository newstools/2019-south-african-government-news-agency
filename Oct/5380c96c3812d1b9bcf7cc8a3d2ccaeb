The Department of Military Veterans (DMV) has apologised for the delays in processing beneficiaries’ school and tuition fees. The department on Tuesday said it has noted that there are outstanding school and tuition fees for some beneficiaries, and that its officials are working hard to speedily address the delays in payment. Currently, the department supports 7 466 learners and students. “The DMV is working on the challenges to fast track payments and is committed to pay all the outstanding 2019 school and tuition fees for all the continuing learners and students, as per its commitment letters and signed agreements,” the department said in a statement. The department drew attention to the following factors that impede faster payments of fees: The department reminded military veterans and beneficiaries that in 2018, a decision was taken to reduce the threshold of basic education support from R42 500 to R20 000, to ensure that as many military veterans’ beneficiaries are provided with education support amidst the shortage of funds. Beneficiaries were given the year to adjust to the reduced threshold, which was only effected during 2019. The closing date for the extended continuing application is 31 October 2019. Application forms are still available on the DMV website: www.dmv.gov.za and conditions stipulated still stand. – SAnews.gov.za
