President Cyril Ramaphosa has assured Springbok captain Siya Kolisi that the national rugby team will enjoy the support of all South Africans in their Rugby World Cup semi-final against Wales today. The Springboks will take on Wales in Yokohama, Japan, at 11am. “I am so proud of you personally and of the team as well. You have done extremely well and I wish you well for the semi-final. You have 57 million South Africans behind you,” the President said in a video call to the Springbok captain on Saturday morning. “I really appreciate the support. Hopefully, we’ll see you at the final,” Kolisi responded. The President also made a commitment that he was coming to the final to lift the (Webb Ellis) Trophy with Kolisi. “Book me a ticket for the final. Give it your very best and know you are doing it for all of us. Strength to all of you,” President Ramaphosa told Kolisi. The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture has also wished the Springboks well in the semi-final match against Wales. Committee chairperson Beauty Dlulane said the progression of the Boks in the tournament since the loss at the opening game has been a marvel to watch. “The Boks have without a doubt put themselves in a good position to lift the trophy," Dlulane said. While acknowledging that it won’t be easy against Wales, Dlulane said the boys will do their best on the field. "The importance of winning this game is massive and the players know that,” Dlulane said. If South Africa wins, the Boks will face England in the final on 2 November 2019. – SAnews.gov.za
