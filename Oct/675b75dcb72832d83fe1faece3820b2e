The Road Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA) has called on members of the public to comment on the draft Regulations developed to govern the implementation of the Administrative Adjudication of the Road Traffic Offences (AARTO) Act. “We welcome the continued debate generated by the promulgation of the AARTO Act and the release of the draft Regulations. We hope all role players would be able to submit their inputs before the expiry of the 30-day period,” RTIA Registrar Japh Chuwe said. The act was published in the Government Gazette, Vol. 652, 11 October 2019, No. 42765 for public comment. President Cyril Ramaphosa signed the Aarto Bill into law in August. Members of the public are particularly invited to make proposals on the Regulations of the Act in an effort to reduce fatalities on the roads. “Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, intends to amend the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Regulations, 2008 by revoking the Regulations published in Government Notice No.R.753 of 16 July of 2008 with the exception of Schedule 3 with the currently publicised Schedule being published for public comments. “Some of the Chapters in the draft Regulations provide details on how the adjudication procedure on the infringements is designed to work. Furthermore, the draft document gives proposals on the appointment and rules governing the operations of the Appeals Tribunal,” RTIA said. Members of the public access the draft regulations on www.rtia.co.za. All objections, inputs or comments should be emailed to RTIA’s Adv. Qacha Moletsane on Qacha.moletsane@rtia.co.za or Department of Transport’s Adv. Ngwako Thoka on thokan@dot.gov.za. - SAnews.gov.za
