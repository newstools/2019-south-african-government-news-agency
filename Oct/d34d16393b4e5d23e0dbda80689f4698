President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to answer questions in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), this afternoon. Questions in Parliament provide an opportunity for the President to account to the nation on several matters pertaining to the work of government. The replies will cover a wide range of issues, including government’s mechanisms to strengthen border control and security in order to deter illegal migration, proliferation of drugs and various forms of cross-border crimes; gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF); strategic interventions to protect the economy and domestic industries, and interventions to assist victims of asbestosis. The President had in the past month called for an urgent Joint Sitting of Parliament on the crisis of violence against women and children in South Africa, where he announced an Emergency Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen existing measures and introduces new interventions in five principal areas. The five principal areas include how to prevent gender-based violence; strengthen the criminal justice system; enhance the legal and policy framework; ensure adequate care, support and healing for victims of violence and improve the economic power of women in South Africa. The President will also brief the NCOP on implementation of the economic stimulus package and recovery plan to revitalise the economy and bolster job creation. The President will further provide feedback on ensuring energy supply in the country. A Special Cabinet Committee on Eskom led by the Deputy President David Mabuza was constituted by the President to deal with the Eskom crisis and to provide him with reports daily on what actions need to be taken to secure energy supply. – SAnews.gov.za
