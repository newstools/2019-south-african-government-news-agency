Sisulu has activated measures that will see her undertaking executive authority over the water and sanitation function in the municipality. The Minister said her intervention in Makhanda is meant to give practical expression to the Constitution’s provision that everyone has the right to have access to sufficient food and water. “A team will be immediately dispatched to Makhanda to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the situation and make concrete proposals on the short, medium and long terms interventions that need to be put in place to ensure that residents and other water users have uninterrupted supply and access to clean and safe drinking water and proper sanitation,” Sisulu said.
