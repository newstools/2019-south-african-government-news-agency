President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to deliver the State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Thursday. It marks the start of the sixth democratic Parliament after the successful conclusion of the country’s General Election in May. President Ramaphosa will deliver the address under the theme ‘Let’s grow South Africa Together as we celebrate 25 years of freedom’, which takes place as the country commemorates 25 years of freedom and democracy. The 25th anniversary celebration is an opportunity to reflect on the country’s successes and challenges, as well as find ways to improve the lives of people. Even though much has been achieved over the past 25 years of freedom, government remains mindful that more still needs to be done in many areas such as united action to reignite economic growth, create jobs and importantly, inspire hope for a better tomorrow. With this in mind, President Ramaphosa is expected to reflect on the country’s political, social and economic welfare, account to the nation on government’s work and further articulate the programme of action for the next five years. The address, which starts at 19:00, will be broadcast live across a number of television and radio stations. Due to economic constraints, various features that have traditionally characterised the preparations and the actual SONA ceremony have been modified for the occasion. It will, however, still preserve the decorum and solemnity of a key State event of such magnitude, such as the military parade. Military rehearsals for the ceremony are scheduled for today and Wednesday from 17:30 to 20:00. As such, Cape Town road users are encouraged to look out for both radio and local newspaper advertisement announcing the temporary road closures and times. After SONA, Parliament will converge again in a joint sitting of both Houses on 25 June to debate the content of the President’s address and on 26 June for the President’s reply. – SAnews.gov.za
