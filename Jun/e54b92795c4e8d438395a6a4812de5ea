A Western Cape court has slapped a farmer accused of water and environmental transgressions with a R3.5 million fine. The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) said its cooperation with the Western Cape’s Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning (DEA&DP), as well the as National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Assets Forfeiture Unit, resulted in Tierhoek Boerdery Pty (Ltd) receiving the hefty fine. The matter first appeared in the Clanwilliam Regional Court in March 2018, culminating in the fine being meted out on Friday. “The Boerdery was taken to court following allegations of unlawful water activities. Tierhoek first appeared in court after the DWS conducted the first Monitoring and Enforcement Blitz in the West Coast region during Enforcement Month of November 2017,” said the department. Following further investigations, six more charges were added resulting in a total 11 criminal charges. The farm owners were found guilty of all charges. Out of the 11 counts, six related to water, while five related to environmental transgressions. The water related counts are as follows: For these contraventions, the offender was instructed to make a payment of R1 250 000 to the DWS, while R1 250 000 will go to DEA&DP, while the NPA will get R1 000 000. Director for Regulation at the department, Boniswa Hene, said the court decision should serve as a deterrent to other National Water Act offenders. “Government acknowledges that the farming community also plays a vital role in the socio-economic development of the country. However, we encourage every water user to respect the law.” Hene called on other potential transgressor to come forward and exercise voluntary compliance with water and related laws. “DWS is available to assist water users with compliance to Regulations,” she said. - SAnews.gov.za
