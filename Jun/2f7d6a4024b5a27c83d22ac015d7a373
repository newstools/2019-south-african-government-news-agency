The historic shipment of 5 200 tons of citrus in a breakbulk vessel has arrived at Shanghai Port in the People’s Republic of China. The Baltic Summer reefer vessel carrying citrus from South Africa to the People’s Republic of China arrived at the Shanghai Port on 10 June 2019. The first shipment was launched on 6 May 2019 at Maydon Wharf Port in Durban. According to the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, the reefer vessel was cleared upon arrival in Shanghai without any sanitary and phytosanitary challenges. The vessel was received by the South African Consul General, Mpho Hlahla, and the department’s attaché to the People’s Republic of China, Mashudu Silimela. Silimela and the team in Plant Health and Inspection Services Directorates played a significant role in the negotiations for the use of breakbulk vessels instead of containers. The Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, Thoko Didiza, has congratulated the department for the successful negotiations that resulted in the approval of breakbulk vessel shipment. She also thanked all parties and the industries that were involved throughout the process since its inception in 2006. “This signals growth to the South African citrus industry in South Africa and will result in the creation of more jobs. The use of breakbulk vessels at the port will clear the congestion at the port due to some challenges currently experienced,” Didiza said. – SAnews.gov.za
