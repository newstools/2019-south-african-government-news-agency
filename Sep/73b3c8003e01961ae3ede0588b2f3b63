The Special Envoys will also reaffirm South Africa’s commitment to the rule of law,” said the Presidency on Sunday. The team appointed by President Ramaphosa began their assignment on Saturday and departed South Africa to deliver messages of solidarity to several Heads of State and Government across the continent. The team, comprising of Jeff Radebe, Ambassador Kingsley Mmabolo and Khulu Mbatha, will visit Nigeria, Niger, Ghana, Senegal, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. The Special Envoys will brief governments in the identified African countries about the steps that the South African government is taking to bring a stop to the attacks and to hold the perpetrators to account. – SAnews.gov.za
