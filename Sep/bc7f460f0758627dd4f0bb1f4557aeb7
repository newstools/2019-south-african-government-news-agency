In an effort to create vibrant agricultural communities and improve food security, the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government will this week launch a multimillion rand Crops Planting Programme in Mkhanyakude District Municipality. The R160 million programme will see the provincial government providing tractors, farming implements and seeds to hundreds of subsistence and smallholder farmers in all 11 district municipalities in the province. The launch on Thursday will be led by KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala, members of the Provincial Executive Committee, traditional leaders and mayors. Speaking ahead of the launch, the MEC for Agriculture and Rural Development, Bongi Sithole-Moloi, said planting crops is one of the provincial flagship programmes that is expected to transform the lives of many small farmers who struggle to produce adequate crops due to the lack of operational farming resources. â€œWe have decided to launch it in September, which is the start of the planting season. We are excited that the head of the provincial government, will be part of the launch," Sithole-Moloi said.
