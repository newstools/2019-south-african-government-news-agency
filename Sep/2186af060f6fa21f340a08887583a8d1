Members of the public have been urged to take advantage of the opportunity to have their wills drafted for free during National Wills Week. During National Wills Week 2019, which takes place from 16 to 20 September, legal practitioners will draft and offer legal advice at no cost to the public. The services are offered through a partnership with Legal Aid South Africa (Legal Aid SA), the Law Society of South Africa and the Justice and Constitutional Development Department. “One of the greatest risks of not having a legitimate will in place is the often nasty family in-fighting over the inheritance of assets, particularly family homes. “Legal Aid SA urges all South African citizens and non-citizens to utilise their over 150 participating attorneys during this week to draft wills at no cost and ensure that their assets are distributed according to their wishes,” Legal Aid SA said in a statement. Legal Aid SA legal practitioners will set up information stalls and service desks at various courts, Master’s Offices and other community venues in all nine provinces to assist with the drafting and completing of basic wills. Furthermore, Legal Aid SA legal practitioners will also address community members on the administration of deceased estates and why it is important to have a will. According to the statistics from the Department of Justice, the 2018 National Wills Week campaign saw free wills drafted and estate advice given to 4 555 people across the country. This was supported by a strong social media awareness campaign which reached 340 754 users nationwide with important information to consider when thinking of estate planning.
