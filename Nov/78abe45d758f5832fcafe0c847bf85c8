With SMMEs set to unlock much needed jobs, the showcase will feature panel discussions on various business questions such as the funding for start-ups and smaller ventures; risks associated with entrepreneurship. Panel discussions will also delve into the work of the South Africa Jobs Fund and its importance as an investor-supporting job creation. The showcase will be held at the University of Johannesburg’s Soweto Campus. The Soweto Campus of the University is the venue for a Business Showcase facilitated by the conference. – SAnews.gov.za
