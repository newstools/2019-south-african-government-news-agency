The Department of Home Affairs says it is currently experiencing a system downtime which has affected the issuing of smart ID cards and passports. However, all other services remain available in all Home Affairs front offices across the country and have not been affected. “A technical team is working around the clock to resolve the issue and restore all services. We apologise for the inconvenience caused to citizens and clients, and remain committed to improving services we render,” said the department on Wednesday. – SAnews.gov.za
