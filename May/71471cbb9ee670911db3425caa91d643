President Cyril Ramaphosa has extended well wishes to South Africa’s Muslim community as they begin fasting for the Holy Month of Ramadan. Ramadan is an annual period during which Muslims around the world undertake prayer, fasting and acts of charity with a special devotional focus. The month also commemorates the revelation of the first verses of the Qu’ran to the Prophet Mohammed, Peace Be Upon Him. President Ramaphosa said the nearly 900 000-strong South African Muslim community is an important and integral part of national diversity and national character. “The positive values that are cherished and practised by Muslims around our country are an important contribution to the ethical and moral renewal that is underway in our society. It is therefore opportune that this holy month unfolds in 2019 at a time when our country is at a decision point and we are on the threshold of new possibilities for growing South Africa together,” President Ramaphosa said in a statement. The President added that, at this time, the religious observance of Muslims and this community’s focus on bettering the lives of disadvantaged citizens around the country is a most welcome providence. – SAnews.gov.za
