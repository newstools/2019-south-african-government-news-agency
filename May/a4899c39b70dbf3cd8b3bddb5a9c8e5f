Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies will this morning attend the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) Ministerial Meeting in India. The aim of the ministerial meeting is to exchange views and ideas on how to best address the challenges facing the Multilateral Trading System (MTS), as well as discuss issues of concern to developing countries. The two-day meeting which gets underway today, is taking place in New Delhi. This as there are different diagnoses of problems facing the MTS. The meeting will provide an opportunity for the exchange of views among participating countries on current developments in the Multilateral Trading System with a view to promote inclusive growth and development. “We need to shape a multilateral trade environment that is conducive and supportive of industrialisation, and supports structural transformation and economic diversification. This includes recognising the necessity of policy space for developing countries, especially African countries to pursue our development objectives and promote regional integration,” said Davies. The Minister further highlighted that the meeting is taking place at a time when global trade is going through a period of uncertainty with an increase in protectionism in some countries and a backlash against trade agreements and globalisation due to lack of inclusive growth. The Government of India that is organising this meeting, expressed the hope that this meeting will provide a direction on how to constructively engage on the various issues facing the WTO. These include the current challenges in the appointment of Appellate Body Members in the build up to the next WTO Ministerial Council meeting that will take place in 2020. The meeting in Delhi will conclude tomorrow. – SAnews.gov.za
