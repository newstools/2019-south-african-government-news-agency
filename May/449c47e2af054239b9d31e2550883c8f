The South African Revenue Service (SARS) has welcomed recently appointed Commissioner Edward Kieswetter with warm hands, as he began his five-year tenure on Wednesday. In a statement, the revenue collector said it looked forward to working with Kieswetter, as SARS looked to rebuild the institution. “In keeping with good governance as well as the relevant policies, the Commissioner has fully disclosed his outside interests and involvement in various organisations,” said SARS in a statement. Kieswetter has already commenced a review of his portfolio of interests and has submitted his resignation as Lead Independent Director of Shoprite. “He has previously resigned from the boards of African Unity and GEMS Education, Africa. Other than personal private investments, his significant involvement includes directorships on Transnet and Technology Innovation Agency, both State-owned enterprises,” said SARS. The revenue collector said Kieswetter has expressed his full commitment to manage his personal affairs in a manner that creates public confidence. - SAnews.gov.za
