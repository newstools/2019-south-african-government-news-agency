South Africa is inching closer to the finish line with 80% of the votes captured in the sixth National and Provincial Elections. The leader board at the IEC’s National Results Operation Centre (ROC) showed that 80% of valid votes cast in the elections had been captured as at 10:36am. This is a significant milestone in the election process, following Wednesday’s Voting Day. Vote counting started as the polls closed at 9am. The ROC continued to be a hive of activity on Friday morning, as IEC officials, observers, political party representatives and media continued to monitor the results as they came in. Valid votes cast had surpassed the 12 million mark in the 2019 elections of which there were 26.7 million registered voters. The African National Congress (ANC) was ahead of the rest on the leader board with 7 318 510 votes, while the Democratic Alliance (DA) was sitting at 2 803 367 in the national results so far. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) were at 1296 724 of votes. Meanwhile, in another milestone, the counting of overseas ballots had commenced.
