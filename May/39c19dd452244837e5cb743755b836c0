An ongoing investigation into a R208 million tender in the eThekwini Municipality has netted a further three suspects. The Hawks said the three were expected to appear before the Durban Specialised Commercial Court. The investigation is being headed by the Hawks’ National Clean Audit Task Team (NCATT). Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said the three will face the same charges as the other nine suspects who were arrested two weeks ago. “The nine were arrested on allegations of fraud and corruption in relation to a 2016 R208 million Durban Solid Waste tender where service providers were allegedly paid huge amounts of monies even though they did not render any service,” said Mulaudzi. The nine suspects are eThekwini Municipality Deputy Head of Strategy and New Development Robert Abbu (62), Supply Chain Manager Sandile Ngcobo (41), Hlenga Sibisi (43), Mzwandile Dludla (24), Sinthamone Ponnan (55), Sithulele Mkhize (38), Bongani Dlomo (53), and Prabagaram Pariah (61). "As indicated previously, the attendance of all those who played a role in the alleged offences, shall be secured before court where the allegations shall be tested," said the National Head of the DPCI, Godfrey Lebeya. – SAnews.gov.za
