Senior researcher at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Renée Koen, says the emergence of new political parties is an important development in any thriving democracy. Speaking to SAnews at the National Results Operation Centre (ROC) in the capital Tshwane on Thursday, Koen said even though the new kids on the block might not have a profound impact on the top three parties in this year’s polls, the introduction of new parties kept democracy dynamic. “This makes our democracy healthier,” Koen said. For the sixth General Election, a record 48 political parties put their hands up to be chosen by the electorate for national and provincial leadership – more than in any election ever held. By 18:36, two newcomers -- GOOD and African Transformation Movement -- featured in the top 10 of the national results, with 58.02% of the valid votes cast having been captured. According to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), by tonight, 90% of the votes would have been counted. – SAnews.gov.za
