Police on Monday arrested a female traveller at the Beitbridge port of entry after South African Revenue Service (SARS) Customs officers intercepted her attempting to smuggle R2 million worth of 198.49kg of crystal methamphetamine. In a statement, SARS said the incident happened when the female traveller with two luggage suitcases was asked to put her possessions through the Customs Baggage Inspection area. “Upon physical inspection, an off-white crystal like substance concealed in multiple colourfully decorated purses with plastics was found, containing substances that reacted positive to tests,” said the revenue collector in the statement. The goods were then detained and handed over to the South African Police Service for safe-keeping and further investigation. The suspect was then arrested. SARS said preliminary investigations indicated that the traveller had flown from abroad into a neighbouring country and tried to enter South Africa by bus through Beitbridge. “Local police have since handed over the matter to the Hawks for much further investigation,” read the statement. The suspect is expected to appear at the Musina Magistrate Court today. SARS said the operation was the result of ongoing cooperation between the revenue collector and other port based law-enforcement agencies to protect borders and facilitate legitimate trade. – SAnews.gov.za
