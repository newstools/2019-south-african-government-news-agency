South Africa has scooped the Africa Federation of Teaching Regulatory Authorities (AFTRA) Award of Fellowship for its work to improve access, quality and efficiency of education systems on the African continent. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga received the award at the 8th Teaching and Learning in Africa Conference held in neighbouring Lesotho. “This award will propel us to double our efforts in ensuring that our African children -- our continental assets -- are exposed to the best education systems possible. “Through our education systems, and our decolonised and diversified curricula, our learners attain the skills, knowledge and competencies for a changing world and the Fourth Industrial Revolution,” said the Minister. AFTRA seeks to ensure that all African countries establish teacher regulatory authorities to professionalise teaching. Motshekga said despite the significant progress made, there is a lot to do. “We must continue to be good ambassadors of education and training systems in our various countries.  This must be inclusive of Early Childhood Development (ECD) and inclusive education for learners with special educational needs. “We must continue to work together to ensure the commitments we have made through our various protocols are fulfilled,” she said. Motshekga said while there is a shortage of educational resources, the working environment and conditions of service for teachers must be improved, and that teachers are empowered with the skills, knowledge and competencies necessary for the changing world. “Education remains the most critical catalyst that will propel the African continent towards the attainment of its development goals,” the Minister said.  – SAnews.gov.za
