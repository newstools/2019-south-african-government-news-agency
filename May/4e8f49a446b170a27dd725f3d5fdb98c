Energy Minister Jeff Radebe has removed Phumzile Tshelane as Chief Executive Officer and Board Member of the Nuclear Energy Corporation of SA (Necsa). Announcing the removal in a statement on Tuesday, Radebe said Tshelane had been removed from office as of Saturday, 11 May. “Please note that having considered the serious nature of the charges against Mr Phumzile Tshelane together with the Board resolution and the recommendation of the disciplinary panel, I have in terms of the Section 17 (1) (c) and 22 (4) (c) of the Nuclear Act, Act 49 of 1999 taken a decision to remove Mr Phumzile Tshelane in his position as the Chief Executive Officer and Board member Necsa,” said the Minister. At a media briefing in December last year, Radebe announced that Tshelane has been placed on precautionary suspension. Meanwhile, the Necsa board will soon embark on the advertising and recruitment process to fill the vacant position in the board. Necsa, which falls under the ambit of the Department of Energy, is responsible for undertaking and promoting Research and Development (R&D) in the field of nuclear energy and radiation sciences. - SAnews.gov.za
