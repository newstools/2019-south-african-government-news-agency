Citizens in Tshwane, especially those in the vicinity of Loftus Versfeld and motorists, are advised to make alternative arrangements as some streets will be closed due to the Presidential Inauguration on Saturday. The democratically elected President of South Africa will be inaugurated on 25 May 2019 at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in the capital. Loftus Versfeld is situated along Kirkness Street in Clydesdale. More than 200 buses from all the provinces in South Africa will arrive in Pretoria from different directions, which will affect streets around and leading to the venue. The Tshwane Metro Police Department, with other law enforcement agencies, will deploy members along venue routes for traffic control and total road closures in Soutpansberg, Loftus and Hatfield. Rietondale Park, which will be used as a park-and-ride area for invited guests, will also be affected.
