The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has assured that the payment date for beneficiaries, who were originally scheduled for payment on Monday, 6 May, has not changed. “An incorrect statement to the effect that social grant beneficiaries using pay points would be paid on 11 May instead of 6 May was circulated last week. To correct this, SASSA wishes to inform beneficiaries, who were originally scheduled for Monday, 6 May, payment date that the date has not changed. “All SASSA cash pay points scheduled for 6 May will be opened and beneficiaries will be able to collect their grants on that day. Beneficiaries will also be able to collect their grants from shops, ATMs and all post offices nationally will be open for grant payments on 6 May. “SASSA wishes to sincerely apologise for last week’s miscommunication and reassure beneficiaries that this type of thing does not happen again. Beneficiaries can call our toll free line 0800 60 10 11 for further enquiries,” SASSA said. – SAnews.gov.za
