The official programme is expected to start at 11am, where President-elect Ramaphosa will take the Presidential Oath of Office and later deliver an address to inform South Africans of his vision and intent during his term of office. The formal programme will be followed by a cultural programme, where other local artists, including Swazi Dlamini, Sibongile Mngoma and Tebogo Mokoena, amongst others, will also showcase their talent. The sixth Presidential Inauguration is celebrated under the theme “Together Celebrating Democracy: Renewal and Growth for a Better South Africa”.
