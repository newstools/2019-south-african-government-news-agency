Results for the North West and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, which had been identified as high-risk areas in the 2019 National and Provincial Elections, have started to trickle in. Earlier this week, the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security (JCPS) cluster and the IEC identified and prioritised potential hotspots in these provinces ahead of South Africans casting their vote on Wednesday. In a statement on Tuesday, the cluster said 51 306 police officers would be deployed in voting stations across the country. As vote counting continued at the IEC’s results centre in Pretoria on Thursday, as at 9:41 am, 34% of the voting districts had completed their vote-counting nationally. In the North West, the African National Congress (ANC) was sitting at 64.75% of the vote followed by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) at 15.28% of the vote in the province. Third in line is the Democratic Alliance (DA) with 10.82% of the vote, followed by the Vryheidsfront Plus at 5.29% of the vote. KwaZulu-Natal, which was battered by floods in recent weeks, had a total of just over five million registered voters - sitting at 5 524 666 registered voters. According to the latest update, 289 400 total votes were cast in the province and a total 5 708 votes were spoilt.
