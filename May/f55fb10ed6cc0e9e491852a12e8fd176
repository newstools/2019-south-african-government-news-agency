Vote counting in the 2019 National and Provincial Elections is nearing the final stretch this morning. By 7am, about 17 208 of 22 925 of the voting districts or 75.06% had declared their results. The tallies up on the large leader board at the IEC’s national results centre in Pretoria, place the African National Congress (ANC) in the lead with 57.21% of the votes, the Democratic Alliance (DA) at 21.84% of the votes and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) at 10.08%. These are, so far, the leading three parties in the race for the national government. They are followed by the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which is currently standing at 2.89%, the Freedom Front Plus (VF Plus) at 2.48%, African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) with 0.92% of the votes and the United Democratic Movement (UDM) at 0.53%. Over 26 million voters were registered to vote in Wednesday’s elections, but the Electoral Commission count thus far puts the voter turnout at 65.44%. Political parties went into the polls with different targets. The ANC wanted to stay in power with over 60% of the voters support; the DA wanted to grow its party support, while the EFF was hoping to double their support. However, so far the biggest surprise in these elections is the performance of the VF Plus which has gained more voters in the provinces.
