Government has called on all South Africans, especially young and first-time voters, to exercise their democratic right to vote. Today, 8 May 2019, is a public holiday and government appeals to employers to allow employees time off so that they can vote. The 26.7 million people who have registered to vote on the 8 May national and provincial elections will be able to cast their votes at one of the 22 924 voting stations countrywide. “With Election Day being a public holiday, this is an opportunity for voters to visit their voting stations throughout the day without creating bottlenecks in the evening,” said the Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) in a statement. Government has urged all South Africans not to leave voting to the last minute. You are eligible to vote if you are: “Voters can verify their registration status and obtain information on their voting district by visiting www.elections.org.za, call the IEC helpline on 0800 11 8000, download the IEC South Africa app, or SMS your ID number to 32810 (R1/SMS) to get your registration status,” the GCIS said. Several security measures have been put in place to ensure safe and peaceful elections. Government will not allow individuals or groups to disrupt the country’s sixth democratic elections and calls on all to respect the right to vote and warn those who aim to disrupt the elections or intimidate voters that they will face the full might of the law. All Home Affairs offices will be open today from 7am to 9pm to assist citizens with the necessary documents for voting. Voters can call Home Affairs on 0800 6011 90 toll free for more information.
