Generally fine and mild weather conditions are expected to prevail over large parts of the country as voters make their way to the polls during Wednesday’s national and provincial elections. The South African Weather Service in a statement on Monday said changes in conditions were expected from tomorrow over the western and central parts. “This will be in the form of scattered thundershowers over the Northern Cape as well as the eastern parts of Western Cape. By Election Day, these thundershowers are expected over the eastern and southern portions of the Northern Cape, far eastern parts of Western Cape, western parts of the North West, Free State, Eastern Cape as well as the extreme southern parts of KwaZulu-Natal,” the weather service said. In the south-west corner of the country, a cold front will result in cool and wet conditions for most of the day. The service has recommended extra caution be taken when erecting temporary structures in the Northern Cape’s eastern parts, western parts of the North West and Free State, as well as the interior of the Eastern Cape as they are expected to experience strong and gusty winds on Election Day. Western Cape is expected to experience a cold front that will move over the south-west coast, leading to cloudy and cool conditions with light rain for most part of the day. “Light rain is also expected to spread along the south coast, to reach the Garden Route district in the evening. Isolated early morning thunderstorms are possible over Prince Albert and Beaufort West municipalities. The rest of the province will experience partly cloudy and cool conditions with strong interior winds in the afternoon,” the service said. The weather service said scattered thundershowers are expected over most parts of the Eastern Cape, while strong winds are expected over the western and central parts of the province ahead of the approaching cold front. Voting stations will open at 7am and close by 9pm. – SAnews.gov.za
