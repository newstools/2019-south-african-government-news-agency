With just a few hours left before the close of voting stations countrywide, government has called on all citizens who are yet to make their mark to do so before polls close at 9pm. “We are pleased that millions of South Africans have heeded the call to vote and have conducted themselves in an orderly and respectful manner. Our message to those who have not yet voted is that your country needs you to stand up and vote,” said the Government Communication and Information System (GCIS). In a statement on Wednesday, the GCIS reminded citizens that their vote matters and can make a difference. Voting across the country in the sixth democratic General Elections got underway at 7am. Voting stations will remain open until 9pm, with those still in the queue at 9pm being allowed to vote. Government is pleased that millions of South Africans have heeded the call to cast their vote. Meanwhile, Home Affairs offices across the country have been open since 7am to assist the public with enabling documents so that they can exercise their democratic right to vote. These offices will remain open until 9pm, in line with the voting hours declared by the Electoral Commission (IEC). In addition, government is encouraged by the swift manner in which isolated incidents, which could have impacted the smooth running of elections, have been resolved. ‘We are confident that all citizens will continue to cast their vote in a safe and secure environment,” the GCIS said. Acting GCIS Chief Executive Officer Phumla Williams appealed to voters, who are yet to cast their vote, not to wait until the last minute to do so. - SAnews.gov.za
