President Cyril Ramaphosa is set to visit the Independent Electoral Commission’s (IEC) Results Operations Centre in Pretoria this morning, where officials, observer missions, political party representatives and media have been camping at, over the past few days. South Africa went to the polls for the sixth democratic National and Provincial elections on Wednesday. Vote-counting started soon after polls closed at 9pm. The President’s visit will allow him the opportunity to see the results capturing process - which shows that the African National Congress (ANC) is set to remain as the governing party. By 9am, about 76.7% of the voting districts across the country had declared their results. The tallies nationally show that the ANC has so far secured 57.18 % of the vote, which is down from its 62% in the last general elections. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is at 21.86 % of the votes and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is at 10.08 % in the race for the national government. The big three are followed by the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) with 2.93 %, Freedom Front Plus (VF Plus) with 2.46 % and African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) with 0.92 %. The outcome of the elections – which are likely to be announced on Saturday - will inform changes to public representation in the national and provincial legislatures. – SAnews.gov.za
