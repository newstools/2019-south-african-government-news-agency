To mark Mandela Month, International Relations and Cooperation Minister Naledi Pandor went beyond painting the classroom and painted a possible future for the pupils of Jan Kotlolo Primary School. The Minister visited the Primary School, accompanied by various ambassadors in Pretoria on Tuesday, where she painted a classroom, handed over donations and addressed Grade 7 pupils to mark Mandela Month. Addressing the pupils, Pandor urged them to embody the ideals of internationalism as envisaged by the late global icon. “We are here bringing a few gifts for the school but it’s not really about the gifts. “What we are bringing is an image of the future and what your future might look like and what your contribution might be to the world,” said Pandor. By bringing the excellencies from the various countries, Pandor said her department wanted to expose the children to what their futures might look like if they work hard and follow the route of internationalism. In addition to the few  necessities donated, Kuwait Ambassador Ayman Aladsani donated R30 000 to the school. This as South Africa and the world marked 10 years of Mandela Day. Nelson Mandela International Day is celebrated on 18 July every year and is recognised as an annual global “day of humanitarian action”. Pandor said she hopes to inspire the pupils to envisage themselves as ambassadors in foreign countries representing their countries. “We bring the life of President Nelson Mandela and we say that is the path in which you should walk,” she said. The Minister thanked the ambassadors for being part of the Mandela Day celebrations, saying they are shaping the leaders of tomorrow. “We believe that you are helping to shape an internationalist character in them because we think a character that has an international component creates a better person, better leader and understanding of the world,” said the Minister. - SAnews.gov.za
