The Gauteng Provincial Government has welcomed the life sentence imposed on a serial child rapist. Livhuwani Vincent Mavhusha was found guilty by the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrate’s Court for the rape of children between the ages of 9 and 12 in Loate, north of Pretoria. The cases of child rape were reported to the police in Loate in 2016. The 41-year old was found guilty on three of nine counts of child rape and was sentenced to three life sentences, which will run concurrently. The court also ordered the convict’s name to be entered into the National Register of Sex Offenders. Gauteng Social Development MEC Thuliswa Nkabinde-Khawe said the harsh life imprisonment given to Mavhusha will serve as a deterrent in a stance to protect women and children in the province. “As the Provincial Government, we take a zero-tolerance approach towards the abuse of women and children. We welcome the sentencing of Mavhusha and it is a victory for all Gauteng children. “Violence has no place in society and we celebrate every time when a perpetrator faces the full might of the law. We applaud the police, the judiciary and everyone who worked so hard to ensure that we arrived at this sentencing,” an elated Nkabinde-Khawe said.
