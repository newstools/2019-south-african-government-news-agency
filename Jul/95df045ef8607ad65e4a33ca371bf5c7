The City of Ekurhuleni has advised residents to make use of other service centres following the closure of the Bedfordview Licensing Centre due to a break-in. “The Bedfordview Licensing Centre and rates hall are closed following the break-in that took place on the evening of Sunday, 14 July 2019,” said the City on Tuesday. The City said preliminary investigations have revealed that intruders gained entry through the roof by cutting all security wirings. Two cash drop-off safes were damaged during the break-in. A large amount of money, eNatis computer box and a plasma TV screen were stolen. The eNatis server was also damaged during the burglary. All services that are offered at the center have been suspended until the investigations and systems reboot are done.  Currently, residents can only access the driver’s licence renewal drive-through. The city has urged residents who want to pay rates and other services to make use of centres such as Germiston, Edenvale and Kempton Park. – SAnews.gov.za
