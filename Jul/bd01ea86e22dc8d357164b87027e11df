Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia de Lille spent 67 minutes of her Mandela Day on Thursday at Athlone in Cape Town, where she donated 20 computers to the Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women and Children. The Minister, accompanied by the staff members in the department, spent the day doing a range of activities with the women and the children at the centre including gardening, pruning, lifting of trees, mowing grass, weeding and filling up open spaces in gardens with plants. There was also a general cleaning operation, unblocking of the main sewer and storm water drains and a carpet was laid at the day care centre. De Lille said the department's assistance will not end on Mandela Day, but continue into the future.
