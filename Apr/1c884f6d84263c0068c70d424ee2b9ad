The South Africa Social Security Agency (SASSA) has reminded child support grant beneficiaries that the grant lapses when the child reaches 18 years old. The SASSA spokesperson in Mpumalanga, Senzeni Ngubeni, said some beneficiaries do not understand when the payment is stopped when the child turns 18. “Beneficiaries must note that the child support grant can also stop if the child has passed on, is no longer in the custody of a caregiver, if the caregiver does not claim the child support grant for three consecutive months, and when living conditions improve to above the [payment] threshold,” Ngubeni said. According to the Social Assistance Act, beneficiaries must report any changes of living standards to ensure that the grant is reviewed immediately. Ngubeni also reminded social grant recipients that the child support grant is aimed at lower income households to assist parents to provide the basic needs of their children. “The child support grant is not meant for a luxury life or to replace other income. It is intended to bridge the gap in the cost of living and look after the child. Society is reminded that nobody is allowed to receive the child support grant for more than six children, who are not biological or legally adopted children.” SASSA has encouraged communities to report all beneficiaries who misuse the child support grant at their nearest local offices. For more information, recipients can contact the SASSA toll free number on 0800 60 10 11 from 8am – 4pm, Monday to Friday. – SAnews.gov.za
